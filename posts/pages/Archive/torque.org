* Measure torque required to turn AN3 nyloc nut

Force required = 1500g force
Arm            = 10cm

torque applied = 15000 g.cm
               = 13 in-lb

Chatted with Leo on Zenith Aircraft Builders; he thinks AN3 nyloc is
more like 1 or 2 lb-in.

Ordered a deflection (beam) torque wrench with starting scale of 0 to
check.
